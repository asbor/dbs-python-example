# 1. Introduction to Data Science

### 1.1 Overview of Data Science

1. Definition of Data Science and relation to other fields
2. Explanation of common Data Science terms
3. Application areas of Data Science Methods and Data Science activities
4. Data sources and shapes
5. Introduction to probability theory and connection to Data Science

## 3) Introduction to Probability theory

### 3.1) Predictability

the two extremes

* Fully deterministic
* It cannot be predicted

predictions possible- but with uncertainty, hence everything is expressed in terms of probabilities

### 3.2) Probability

> What is the chance that some event e will occur out of the union Î© of all possible events

Example: The dice has to show one of 1,2,...,6. P(e)=1/6

the dice

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$
